See https://www.overleaf.com/read/pxsnznvndnbp#a53d8f for a full write-up.

In short, this project answers the question of where is the best place to throw on a dartboard, assuming there is variation in one's aim. It answers this question through Monte Carlo simulations which calculate the average score when many darts are thrown at a given center point, and brute forces its way to calculate the best (i.e. highest average).
